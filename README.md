# 🔍 **LidarSight: Real-Time Object Detection Using LiDAR Data**

## 📌 Project Description

**LidarSight** is a real-time object detection system leveraging LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data for accurate spatial recognition and mapping. Built using MATLAB, this project processes raw point cloud data to detect and visualize objects in 3D environments. It has applications in autonomous driving, robotics, environmental modeling, and other fields requiring precise spatial awareness.

This repository demonstrates how LiDAR sensor data can be transformed and interpreted using computer vision and machine learning principles to detect objects dynamically and efficiently.
